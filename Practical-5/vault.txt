To inspect the quality of concrete structures, surface voids or bugholes existing on a concrete surface after the casting process needstobedetected.Toimprovetheproductivityoftheinspectionwork,thisstudydevelopsahybridintelligenceapproachthat combines image texture analysis, machine learning, and metaheuristic optimization. Image texture computations employ the Gabor ﬁlter and gray-level run lengths to characterize the condition of a concrete surface.Based on features of image texture, Support Vector Machines (SVM) establish a decision boundary that separates collected image samples into two categories of nosurface void(negativeclass)and surfacevoid(positiveclass).Furthermore,toassisttheSVM modeltrainingphase,thestate-of- the-art history-based adaptive diﬀerential evolution with linear population size reduction (L-SHADE) is utilized.+e hybrid intelligence approach, named as L-SHADE-SVM-SVD, has been developed and complied in Visual C#.NET framework.
Ex- periments with 1000 image samples show that the L-SHADE-SVM-SVD can obtain a high prediction accuracy of roughly 93%. +erefore, thenewlydevelopedmodelcanbea promisingalternativeforconstructioninspectorsinconcretequality assessment.1.Research Background +e construction industry is widely known as a highly competitive environment within which product quality is acrucialelementforacontractor’ssurvival[1].Inadditiontothe project cost and schedule, quality is a key factor thatdeterminescustomersatisfaction[2].Typically,forhigh-riseconcrete buildings, architects and project owners impose strictspeciﬁcationsontheconditionoftheconcretesurface.+ese requirements often involve the delivery of high-quality concrete surface with minimum presence of surfacevoids or bugholes [3].
It is because the phenomenon ofexcessive bugholes is one of the most serious and widelyencountereddefectson aformedconcrete surface[4]and isoftenasubjectofdisputebetweenprojectowners,architects,and construction contractors [3]. Surface voids (see Figure 1) generally refer to small pitsandcratersontheconcretesurfaceobservedaftertheprocess of formwork removal [5].+ese defects arebrought about by the migration of an entrapped air bubble to the interface between fresh concrete and formwork [6].+e diameter of these voids typicallyranges from several millimeters to 15 millimeters andeven25millimetersinsomecases[4].Formoredetailsonthe factors leading to the excessive presence of bugholes,readers are guided to the technical paper compiled byACI [4].In addition, bugholes are often distributedscatteredly on the concrete surface [7].
A high density of surface voids can result in several harmful eﬀects on the performance of concrete structures: (i) Bugholesobviouslyreducetheaestheticsofconcrete structures (ii) +ese voids reduce the protective depth of concrete structuresandmakethereinforcementsinsidethemmore vulnerable to corrosion [6]Hindawi Advances in Civil Engineering Volume 2020, Article ID 4190682, 15 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/4190682 (iii) For structures retroﬁtted by ﬁber-reinforced plastic (FRP)material,excessivevoidsreducetheadhesion properties of the FRP material applied to thestructure surface [8] (iv) Recent works have pointed out that salt accumu- lated in surface voids can lead to premature deg-radation of reinforced concrete structures [6, 9] (v) Existence of bugholes does increase the cost and time of painting and ﬁnishing activities becauseadditionalcorrectionsmustbeperformedtoachievea ﬂat concrete surface [5] Consequently, project owners and architects demand thatthenumberofsurfacevoidsonconcretesurfacesshould be limited to ensure the aesthetic appearance and durability of concrete structures.

[19], the manual procedure also brings safety threat to human in- spectors since certain concrete surfaces cannot be reachedwithease,especiallyforthosewhicharelocatedathigh/rooflevels and narrow space. +e current practice is alsoproblematic due to the unavoidable inconsistency ininspecting outcomes.+e reason is that the assessmentprocess is dependent of subjective judgment of humantechnicians [2, 3].+erefore,projectownersareincreasinglyseekingfor fast, eﬀective, and consistent tools to better structurecondition assessment [19–24].+e assessment outcomes can also enhance communication between various stakeholders regarding the condition of the buildings.Image processing and machine learning with their fastpace of improvement provide feasible means to achievesuch goals.Processed digital images and machine intel-ligence are capable of automating the concrete surfacecondition assessment, especially the task of detectingsurface voids.
Hence, in the recent years, various state-of-the-art methods relying on these two aforementioned techniqueshave been proposed to tackle the problem of interest. ZhuandBrilakis[25]putforwardanimageprocessingapproach employing image segmentation and merging/splitting of pixels to detect air pockets on the concrete surfaces.Santosand Julio [26] presented an approach relying on the digitalimage processing and laser scanning techniques to analyzethe roughness of the substrate surface.Fekri-Ershad andTajeripour [27] put forward a robust approach based on aone-dimensionallocalbinarypatternforrecognizingsurfacedefect.da Silva and ˇStemberk [28] also employed image processing (i.e., image binarization and morphological an-alyses) and fuzzy logic to inspect the surface quality of self-consolidating concrete for precast members with a focus on the presence of bugholes.
Tajeripour and Fekri-Ershad [29] proposed novel one-dimensional local binary patterns usedfor recognizing abnormalities in stone textures. Kwasny et al.[30] investigated theinﬂuence of rheology onthequalityofsurfaceﬁnishofcement-basedmortars;thesurface voids existing on concrete were then analyzed andquantiﬁed via digital image processing.Sadowski andMathia [31] pointed out the needs of a more useful methodfor characterizing properties of a heterogeneous concretesurface; the authors also reviewed various image analyzingtools including image ﬁltering and transformation.+e eﬀectiveness of wavelet transform and Gaussian image ﬁl- teringindetectingsurfacedefectswerestudiedbyGo ¨ıcetal.[32].LiuandYang[33]extractedthefeaturesofbugholesona concrete surface via the utilization of the Otsu imagebinarization method.
A texture classiﬁcation model thatincorporates of gray-level run-length matrix and robustilluminationnormalizationtechniqueshasbeenconstructedbyDashandSenapati[34].Khanetal.[35]reliedongroundpenetrating radar to detect water inside the cavities ofconcrete hollow core slabs. Yoshitake et al.[36] relied on binary image and color image analyses to detect bugholes distributed on sidewallsandtunnel-liningconcrete.Perezetal.[19]utilizedthestate-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for detecting and categorizing building surface defects.A novel instance-level recognition and quantiﬁcation for concretesurface bughole based on the deep neural network has beenrecently developed by Wei et al.[18]; this study demon-strates a great capability of machine learning in identifyingconcrete void surfaces accurately.Nevertheless, the imple-mentation of deep learning models often requires a largenumber of training samples and a capable computingcapability.
As can be seen in the current literature, previous works have mainly relied on image thresholding methods for detecting concrete surface voids. +ese methods require substantialﬁne-tuningtoadapttovariablecharacteristicsofheterogeneous concrete surface [31].Due to the complexityof concrete surface background and varying lighting con-ditions,theaccuracyandapplicabilityofimagethresholdingmethods are generally limited.+erefore, image processingtechniques should be integrated with advanced machinelearning methods to deal with such issues.Hybrid imageprocessing and machine learning tools have demonstratedtheir outstanding performances in detecting concrete sur-faces in previous studies [15, 37–39].However, too fewstudies have dedicated to investigating hybrid image proc- essing—machine learning models for the problem of con- crete surface void detection.+erefore, the current work isan attempt to ﬁll this gap in the current literature.
Inthisstudy,imageprocessingtechniquesincludingthe Gabor ﬁltering and gray-level run lengths are employed tocompute image texture of a concrete surface with andwithoutvoids.+etextureinformationis,then,employedbythe Support Vector Machines (SVM) to discriminate thesetwo groups of concrete surface. Furthermore, since thetraining phase of the SVM-based bughole detection modelrequires a proper setting of the hyperparameters including the penalty coeﬃcient and the kernel function parameter, the history-based adaptive diﬀerential evolution with linearpopulation size reduction (L-SHADE) [40, 41] is used tooptimize the model training phase.It is because these twohyperparameters strongly inﬂuence the learning and pre-dicting performances of the SVM model.If the penaltycoeﬃcient and the kernel function parameter are not de-termined appropriately, the SVM-based surface void de-tection model cannot deliver the desired due to eitheroverﬁtting or underﬁtting phenomena [42, 43].

Subsequently, numerical features are extractedfromthesesamplestoconstructthemachinelearning-basedsurface void recognition model.In this study, the Gaborﬁlterandgray-levelrun-lengthmethodsareusedforfeatureextraction.A novel method combining the SVM and L-SHADE is employed for data classiﬁcation.2.1.Gabor Filter (GF).
